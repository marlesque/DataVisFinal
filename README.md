The parameter are the states that have the greatest average price for a pound of honey, the largest total production, and stock prices. This is meant to be interactive as you have to select a button which represents the right answer. I've designed this to be an interactive trivia, where the viewer may click on different buttons.

You have to scroll all the way to the bottom to yield a result.
